PyCon has always been more than just a conference. It has been a place where people who have similar interests find each other and have great conversations.

This time, we want to make room for more such conversations. This time, we are going to make Open Spaces more exciting.

For those who don't know what an open space is, it is a place for people to come together and work on / share something. This can be anything like hacking on some open source project (A feature hack, a Bug bust, etc), share some tips on getting starting with open source, sharing a cool refactor technique, talking about how a technology is used in ones workplace, a crash course on static site generators, or even an all out vim VS emacs battle. The best part of an open space is that there is no schedule, there are no pre decided talks. They are entirely up to the people who attend the conference. Just get there, make an announcement and get down to it. 

From our side, this time, we plan to use the open spaces to host the speakers whos talks didn't into the main track. This way, the people who were interested in their topics can catch up with them at the event itself.

We always encourage people **not** to attend all the talks. We believe that there is a lot that you can learn from the other peers attending the talk.

So make sure that when you come to PyCon this time, you skip attending a talk, go over to the open space and interact with someone or even better, do something yourself!
